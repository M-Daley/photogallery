Special thanks too my best friend Joseph Stewart for lending me their art work to be apart of this portfolio project!

  

## Photo Gallery

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It leverages Nextjs api routes to serve and map each image to their own panel. React-scroll is used on the button at the foot of the website allowing the user to scroll up cleanly. Soon to come AOS to enable transition effects for each picture/gif while scrolling down (this feature will be disabled for users who request animations turned off).
